Nice choice! Predicting **BMI using lifestyle and demographic factors** is super practical, interpretable, and rich with potential insights. You’ll also be able to apply regression models like **Linear Regression** and possibly decision trees if you explore non-linear relationships.

Here’s a step-by-step **action plan** tailored to your project:

---

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Action Plan: BMI Prediction Project**

### 🟢 **Step 1: Define Your Question & Goal**
- 📌 **Main Question:** *Can we predict a person’s BMI based on their lifestyle habits and physical traits?*
- 🧠 **Bonus Angle (Optional):** What are the most important predictors of BMI? How can people improve it?

---

### 📊 **Step 2: Calculate BMI and Add It to the Dataset**
- BMI = **Weight (kg) / Height² (m²)**
- Add it as a new column: `BMI`

---

### 🧼 **Step 3: Data Cleaning**
- Check for:
  - Missing values
  - Inconsistent categorical variables (e.g., “no” vs “No”)
  - Convert categorical values to numerical (e.g., using one-hot encoding)
- Normalize or scale continuous features (important for regression)

---

### 🔍 **Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize distributions (histograms for `BMI`, bar plots for categorical vars)
- Look for correlations between `BMI` and each feature
- Scatterplots: e.g., `BMI` vs. `CH2O` (water intake), `BMI` vs. `FAF` (physical activity)
- Group stats: average BMI by `Gender`, `MTRANS`, `family_history_with_overweight`

---

### 🧪 **Step 5: Modeling (Start with Linear Regression)**
- **X (features):** age, FCVC, NCP, CAEC, CH2O, SCC, FAF, TUE, CALC, MTRANS, etc.
- **y (target):** BMI
- Split data into train/test
- Fit linear regression model
- Interpret coefficients (which variables increase BMI?)

✅ Optional: Try **Decision Tree Regressor** to explore non-linear effects

---

### 📏 **Step 6: Evaluate Your Model**
- Use:
  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
  - **R² (coefficient of determination)**  
- Plot predicted vs. actual BMI values
- Residual plots to see if error is random

---

### 🧠 **Step 7: Conclusions**
- Which variables matter most for BMI?
- What patterns are surprising or expected?
- How accurate is your model, and what are its limitations?

---

### 🔮 **Step 8: Future Work**
- Could you improve it with more data?
- Could classification (e.g., underweight/normal/obese) offer a new perspective?
- Could you apply this in a health app or awareness campaign?

---

### 💻 **Step 9: Prepare Deliverables**
- 📂 Create a **GitHub repo**
- 🧪 Final **Jupyter Notebook** with full code, markdowns, and plots
- 📽️ **Slide deck** or **notebook presentation view** for final oral evaluation
- 📄 Clearly show how you followed the **data science lifecycle**
