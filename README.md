**Background**

_https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/risk-factors/risk-factors.html_

The CDC cites physical activity, eating patterns, sleep quality and quantity, and electronic use as risk factors for obesity.
Our dataset, which we found in the class data folder, contains many of these risk factors as features. Our goal is to explore 
a decision tree classifier for obesity level to see how well these lifestyle choices, as well as some biological traits, impact obesity level. 
We also explore how much each risk factor contributes to obesity. 

This exploration has potential application in the field of public health,
