- Created markdown explaining dataset features to assist with cleaning and feature selection
- Chose model - Decision tree classifier for Obesity Level
- Levels: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese

Model Evaluation - what we did in lab:

* print out model

* variable importance
* confusion matrix


Things to review: 
- Greedy algorithm
- Cross validation
- Maybe: math behind it (Gini Coefficient, Entropy)
   -  Algorithm uses the split that minimizes SSE
